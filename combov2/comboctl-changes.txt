The code in comboctl/ is ComboCtl minus the jvmMain/ code, which contains code for the Linux platform.
This includes C++ glue code to the BlueZ stack. Since none of this is useful to AndroidAPS, it is better
left out, especially since it consists of almost 9000 lines of code. When updating ComboCtl, it is
important to keep this in mind.

Differences between the copy in comboctl/ and the original ComboCtl code must be kept as little as
possible, and preferably be transferred to the main ComboCtl project. This helps keep the comboctl/
copy and the main project in sync.
